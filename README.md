# Modern Design Game Launcher Application UI

Aplication with a built-in game library along with a featured dicovery page

## Description

Overview

This game application is a WPF desktop application built with C# .NET and XAML, using the MVVM pattern. It currently has a user game library, a featured discovery page, and a home page. I plan to add a settings option and backend functionality in the future.

User Game Library

The user game library allows users to view and manage their collection of games. Users can  view information about each game, such as the game's title, genre, release date, and publisher.

Featured Discovery Page

The featured discovery page showcases a selection of popular and new games. Users can browse the featured games, read reviews, and add games to their library from this page.

Home Page

The home page is the main landing page for the application. It provides users with quick access to their game library, the featured discovery page, and other important features of the application.

MVVM Pattern

The MVVM pattern is a software development pattern that separates the user interface (UI) from the business logic of an application. This makes the application more maintainable and scalable.
